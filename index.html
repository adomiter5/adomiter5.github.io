                    "Animals are the bridge between us and the beauty of all that is natural. They show us what's missing in our lives, and how to love ourselves more completely and unconditionally. They connect us back to who we are, and to the purpose of why we're here."

                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">This anthology of children’s poems highlights the various roles of animals in children’s literature. In this collection, animals are defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “any such living organism other than a human being”. Moreover,
                    for this anthology, “children’s poems” refers to poems written for children and those that were written with children in mind. The author argues that animals are salient and recurring characters in many forms of children’s literature.
                    Therefore, this collection of poems will illustrate the role of animals in poetry and whether these roles change with respect to various constructs of childhood (e.g. Puritan, Enlightenment, Romantic). I created this anthology with
                    the following questions in mind: What is significant about the animal(s) used in these poems? How are they different or similar to humans? What is gained or lost by using the animal(s)? </p>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">Overall, these poems reveal that animals take on many roles from teacher to companion to entertainer throughout time. Poems written under the Puritan and Englightenment views of childhood emphasize the qualities of animals that best serve
                    the purpose of educating children on what to do and what is right. In contrast, poems written under the Romantic view of childhood call attention to the connection between animals and the natural world. Animals are seen as companions
                    or equal that warrant admiration by humans. Lastly, concerning nonsense poetry, the primary role of animals is to entertain and provide enjoyment to its audience, children. In these poems, animals are given human-like qualities and
                    perform human actions. These roles are discussed in detail in the following sections. Despite a few differences, it is clear that animals themselves bring greater meaning to these poems that human characters can not do alone.

            <div class="row pt-4 pb-0 mb-0 bg-warning bg-opacity-10 ">
                <div class="display-6 " style="font-size: 30px; " id="puritan"> Puritan & Enlightenment views of Childhood</div>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">In the 18th century in England and Colonial America, there were two dominant views on childhood. The first view, the Puritan view, of childhood followed that children are sinful. Children were born with the burden of Adam’s sin, and adults
                    must guide them away from sinning. The second view, the Enlightenment view, of childhood, followed that children were a “blank slate.” They came into the world with an empty mind, and it was upon education systems in place to influence
                    children’s moral and mental capacities. This view brings a more secular approach to childhood. </p>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;"> Therefore, it is understandable that the animal's role, under these two perspectives, is to educate and guide children in accordance with religion and rationality. What each animal teaches children varies from poem to poem. Moreover, the
                    animals featured in these poems are carefully selected to help communicate the intended lesson. For instance, in “Against Idleness and Mischief,” Isaac Watts emphasizes the qualities of a bee that will best support the poem’s purpose
                    of teaching children the importance of hard work. The bee is described as “busy,” “skillful,” and “neat.” It is implied that these are all qualities a child should possess. However, in “Against Quarreling and Fighting,” Watts uses
                    the “nature” of dogs, bears, and lions as an example of behaviors children should not possess or avoid copying. This is evident in the first stanza of the poem: “Let dogs delight to bark and bite, / For God hath made them so: / Let
                    bears and lions growl and fight, / For 'tis their nature, too.” The idea that animals are entirely separate from humans but exhibit similar qualities is further explored by “The Caterpillar”, written by Anna Barbauld. Anna Barbauld
                    was well-known for her politically-charged writings and is a harsh critic of the revolution. In this poem, the significance and beauty of the caterpillar and the brutality of using pesticides are a reflection of the the negatives aspects
                    of human nature. Through the caterpillar, Barbauld aims to teach children about the complexities of life. William Blake, like Barbauld, chooses to use animals to tackle equally complex topics, the existence of evil and danger, in “The
                    Tyger”. In all, these pre-Romantic poems were chosen for their use of animals in educating children.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row pt-4 pb-0 mb-0 bg-warning bg-opacity-10 ">
                <div class="display-6 " style="font-size: 30px; " id="romantic"> Romantic Childhood</div>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">Following the Englightenment was the Romantic movement. The Romantic view of childhood stems from the belief that children are neither bad nor neutral, but good. Children are naturally innocent; therefore, children should live a natural
                    life that is free from or has limited formal education. Additionally, children held spiritual wisdom in relation to nature which is lacking in adults. </p>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">As a result, the animal’s role in Romantic poetry is to be appreciated as they serve as companions or as equals to humans. The poems in this anthology that best depict these roles include “To A Skylark,” “A Wren’s Nest,” “Three Foxes by
                    the Edge of the Field at Twilight”, and “A Night with a wolf.” Unlike in pre-Romantic poems, the animals featured in these poems are chosen because of the poet's encounters or their presence in the natural environment. Animals are
                    seen as an extension of the natural world and thus are represented as almost godlike. In “To A Skylark” by William Wordsworth, Wordsworth describes the action and behavior of a skylark and an intense evaluation of Mother Nature’s creation
                    and its relation to the divine. In the poem, the skylark showers onto the ground a “flood of harmony” from his “privacy of glorious light” which gives the effect as if God is showering his blessing on the earth. Similarly, in "A Wren’s
                    nest,” Wordsworth expresses his appreciation for the action and behavior of the wren regarding building its home. The home itself is described as warm, beautiful, and a “perfect recess.” Likewise, although “Three Foxes by the Edge
                    of the Field at Twilight” is a poem written in the 20th century, this poem also features animals in the foreground as a sign of appreciation for Mother Nature. The poem does not distort or utilize the animals to express a lesson or
                    entertain. In combination with “A Night with a wolf”, it becomes apparent that the role of these animals is to be present as they are. While this is true, it is also worth noting that this may not be clear in poems such as “The Butterfly”
                    by Adelaide O’Keefe, which has been provided because of its thought-provoking description of the butterfly. O’Keefe writes, “The butterfly, an idle thing.”

                <div class="display-6 " style="font-size: 30px; " id="nonsense"> Anthropomorphism and Nonsense</div>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;"> Finally, out of the Romantic movement came nonsense literature. Literary nonsense was only first written for children in the early nineteenth century and was popularized by Edward Lear and then by Lewis Carroll. Nonsense poetry is important
                    because it moved away from the standardized and religious messages of many early works of children’s literature towards a genre of works that focused on entertainment and enjoyment. </p>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;"> Within this anthology, a few poems blur the distinction between animals and humans. These poems use anthropomorphism, a technique in which animals are given human traits, ambitions, emotions, or entire behaviors. Anthropomorphism is a
                    prominent feature of nonsensical poetry as it distorts our expectations about how animals should and do act. For instance, in “The Owl and the Pussy-cat” by Edward Lear, the owl, the pussycat, the pig, and the turkey are anthropomorphized.
                    The owl and the pussycat get married, they have money (which they use to buy a ring from the pig), and they go on adventures together. The primary purpose of such depiction of animals is to entertain children. Children's poetry during
                    this time became a place for fantasy and play. This resulted in a construct of childhood that focused less on a time of preparation for adult life and more on the fantastical experience separate from it. In “How Doth the Little Crocodile”
                    by Lewis Carroll, the crocodile is said to “grin” and “smile”. This parody of “Against Idleness and Mischief” by Isaac Watts is meant to achieve a comical or satirical effect. That being said, anthropomorphism also enables children
                    to understand more complex subjects like money and marriage or issues since topics are adapted to children's worldview. “This Little Piggy” by Mother Goose, although older, also uses anthropomorphism to convey darker themes that would
                    otherwise be overwhelming for a child to grapple with. These poems provide evidence of how the boundary between humans and animals becomes distorted. </p>

                <div class="display-6 " style="font-size: 30px; " id="add"> Additional Remarks</div>
                <p class="display-6" style="font-size: 16px;">Due to the scope of this anthology, a greater focus was placed on describing the role assigned to the animal(s) in each poem although the way in which each animal is described and why a specific animal is chosen (i.e. why William Blake
                    chose to write about a tiger instead of a crocodile like Lewis Carroll) is equally important. From the selected poems, the way in which animals are described or introduced varies in many ways. For example, in “The Caterpillar” and
                    “The Butterfly”, both animals play an essential part in the experience of the child but are not the main character. They serve as an element of the poem’s setting and are the mechanism in which the child learns more about their own
                    (the child’s) position in the world. In contrast, in “This Little Piggy”, the pigs serve as the main character. One reason why animals serve as main characters in many poems for children is that they make the work more enjoyable and
                    can help teach children complicated aspects of humanity. This is best depicted in works that use anthropomorphism. </p>
